# DYNAMIC-EFFECTS-OF-CHANGES-IN-GOVERNMENT-SPENDING-AND-TAXES-ON-OUTPUT
This exercise focuses on replicating the findings of Blanchard and Perotti (2002), specifically
examining how tax revenue shocks influence economic variables. By replicating and analyzing
these results, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the dynamic responses to tax revenue
shocks and their broader economic implications.
